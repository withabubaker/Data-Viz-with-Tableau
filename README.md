# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
This project aims to visualize and analyze Airbnb data in NYC.
      Answer the below questions:
     - Try to find if there is any correlation between location, number of beds, property type and AVG price.
     - Predict the growth of hosts in two years

## Process
1- Download the dataset from the internet.
2- Try to understand the relation between the features and average price, by virtualizing each feature and average price.
3- Use the analysis feature in Tableau to build two years prediction and regression model.
4- create the dashboard that contains all the virtualizations and publish it here https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mohammed.abubaker/viz/LHL_Project/Dashboard1?publish=yes

## Results

I used option 2 (AirBnBNYC), tried to answer the questions mentioned in the project goals, and here are my findings:
- Staten Island and Bronx are the most expensive areas with average prices of $850 and $757 per night.
- Manhattan has the highest number of hosts and average price.
- Villas are the most expensive property type with $328 per night.
- More than 27,000 of the properties are apartments.
- There is a correlation between the number of beds and the average price more beds probably will increase the price.
- There is a significant decrease in the number of new hosts in 2015. From almost 8000 new hosts in 2014 to slightly above 5000 in 2015.
- The below model predicts an increase in new hosts in 2016 up to 9452 but it will decrease in 2017 to 4962.



## Challenges 
fitting all the visualizations in one dashboard.

## Future Goals
If I had more time, because the data is old (till 2015), I would compare the 2017 prediction with the actual value.
